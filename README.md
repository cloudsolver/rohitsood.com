[The Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) 2023 edition on Amazon Web Services for my resume.

I am documenting my journey with the steps I took to define and refine my resume online on [RohitSood.com](https://www.rohitsood.com) 

## Steps 

### 1. AWS Cloud Practioner certification

I created a [repo with my notes](https://github.com/cloudsolver/aws-cpc) for the AWS Cloud Practioner exam. [Credly Link]()

While I have been using AWS since 2016 - when I built out my [personal site](https://www.rohitsood.com), a [business site](https://www.digitaldivvy.com/) and in 2017 an online [B2B SaaS](https://www.garagedata.io/) in my spare time - I never really focussed on taking a certifcation. Just when I started to read the whitepapers,  I decided to try my hand at management with a Senior Director of Architecture role for almost 4 years that kept me busy leading people and process. 


### 2.HTML 3. CSS 4. Static Website 7. Javascript
The cloud resume challenge is a bit out of order for the workflow for someone who needs to build something locally. One, the resume must be  developed in HTML, styled with CSS, and use Javascript for a counter and overall must be a static site that can be hosted on Simple Storage Service (S3) that can host a website.

I decided to build a simply HTML, CSS, JS static site using [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/). Installed `nvm` and `node 18` to globally install `http-server` for local testing.

In order to use github from the command line on my PopOS - SSH keys need to be created. Here is the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) I followed.
