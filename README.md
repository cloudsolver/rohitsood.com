[The Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) 2023 edition on Amazon Web Services for my resume.

I am documenting my journey with the steps I took to define and refine my resume online on [RohitSood.com](https://www.rohitsood.com) 

## Steps 

### 1. AWS Cloud Practioner certification

I created a [repo with my notes](https://github.com/cloudsolver/aws-cpc) for the AWS Cloud Practioner exam.

While I have been using AWS since 2016 - when I built out my [personal site](https://www.rohitsood.com), a [business site](https://www.digitaldivvy.com/) and in 2017 an online [B2B SaaS](https://www.garagedata.io/) in my spare time - I never really focussed on taking a certifcation. Just when I started to read the whitepapers,  I decided to try my hand at management with a Senior Director of Architecture role for almost 4 years that kept me busy leading people and process.
