[The Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) 2023 edition on Amazon Web Services for my resume.

I am documenting my journey with the steps I took to define and refine my resume online on [RohitSood.com](https://www.rohitsood.com) 

## Steps 

### 1. AWS Cloud Practioner certification

I created a [repo with my notes](https://github.com/cloudsolver/aws-cpc) for the AWS Cloud Practioner exam.

While I have been using AWS since 2016 - when I built out my personal site, my wife's business site and in 2017 an online B2B SaaS in my spare time - I never really focussed on certifcation. Then I went into a management role for almost 4 years that kept me busines leading people and process.
