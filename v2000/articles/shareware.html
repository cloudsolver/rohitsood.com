            and Shareware basically share the same origin. Prior to the introduction 
            of the IBM PC in 1981, user-groups and BBSs of other computer companies 
            like CP/M machines, Radio Shacks and Apple, passed around software 
            for which the programmer expected less payment. This was because the 
            programs were small and simple, for which support was not on offer, 
            and therefore could not be considered up-market. In 1982, two programmers 
            Andrew Flugleman and Jim Knopf wrote a couple of major applications, 
            videlicet a communications program and a database program respectively 
            on their new IBM PC’s. Not wanting to invest the time and money in 
            trying to get these applications into scores, they decided to take 
            advantage of the distribution networks by allowing their program to 
            be available in abundance. </font></td>

              the software was not really intended to be free. As had been done

            successful business. He called it ‘Shareware’. While there were numerous 
            smaller programs and utilities, such as Vern Buerg's wildly popular 
            LIST program, these three major applications were popular with many 
            major businesses, and established the credibility of Freeware as a 
            source of high quality and dependable support (today the views are 
            diametrically opposite). That then paved the way for other, even more 
            successful programs (and tens of thousands less successful programs) 
            to be marked the same way. </font></td>

            in a popular computer magazine and a contest to find a new name for 
            "Freeware". While "Freeware" was widely used, it was trademarked and 
            could not be used by many legally. The alternate phrase then was "User 
            Support Software" which was too cumbersome. The most popular choice 
            of the readers' was "Shareware". Incidentally, this was the name; 
            Bob Wallace had given to PC-Write, his word processing program. It 
            became mandatory to ask Mr. Wallace about the authenticity and exclusive 
            claims to the term "Shareware". Wallace had no claims and admitted 
            to have read the name elsewhere, the popular computer magazine then 
            announced the winning name, thus changed the names of "Freeware" to 
            "Shareware". </font></td>

            of shareware library to members. In California, Richard Peterson an

            mainly on the conscience of the individual to eventually do the right 
            thing and order the product to continue use of the program. This honesty 
            factor is fully capitalized by Microsoft, which as a company policy 
            does not protect its software from piracy (it is fairly simple to 
            put a CD copy lock), thus hoping that the prospective consumers buy 
            the product after using the pirated copy. They hope that the user 
            will appreciate the difference between a pirated copy and the benefits. 
            Though, this approach is not shareware, it is effective nonetheless. 
            However the shareware method completes a trust that the author initiates 
            releasing the program via the shareware method. The author's success 
            is not only dependent on the usefulness of the program and it's distribution, 
            but the conscience of the person using it. </font></td>

            the actual registration to download ratio has a variety of factors, 
            extensive distribution is the key to obtaining the highest number 
            of registrations. As a rule, the more people download it, the more 
            people will register it. Most shareware authors begin by uploading 
            their program all over the place, wherever they can. This can take 
            hours, days, even weeks. Some shareware authors give their programs 
            to shareware CD writers for distribution. A variety of places offer 
            distribution of an author's shareware program. Some services overlap, 
            some do not, some are free, some are not, some create CD-ROMs, some 
            do not. As a thumb rule, in India a shareware CD-ROM rather than direct 
            Internet uploads are the best bet for upcoming programmers to reach 
            out to the Indian masses with their work. Besides saving a lot of 
            time, energy and money, it is efficient, effective and mutually beneficial. 
            It is, therefore in our interest to support shareware, and more so 
            on CD ROMs (DVDs in the near future?), until the connectivity speeds 
            and the costs of Internet time reduces. </font></td>
