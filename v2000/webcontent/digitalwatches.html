            to reminisce. As long as you don't make your home<br>
            permanently in the past, there's nothing wrong with occasionally going 
            back and<br>
            slipping a memory on like a comfortable old shoe. Today, we hearken 
            back to my<br>
            first digital watch. </font>

              The year was 1975. A fellow by the name of Ford was the President, 
              and every<br>
              Saturday night I looked forward to watching Chevy Chase imitate 
              his trips and<br>
              falls (that the news camera always seemed to catch). The Big Red 
              Machine was<br>
              still running. Disco hadn't yet reared its ugly head. Polyester 
              was fashionably<br>
              hot. The world was running out of oil. 8-track vs. cassette was 
              a debatable<br>
              subject. Many of us prayed for a Beatles reunion. I was working 
              my first "real"<br>
              job, sacking groceries for $2.10 an hour at Phillip's Grocery in 
              Pea Ridge,<br>
              Arkansas.</span></font></p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><span style="letter-spacing: 1pt"><br>
              It was under such circumstances that I obtained my first LED digital 
              watch.&nbsp;<br>
              The wristwatch of the day didn't bear much resemblance to what we 
              wear now.<br>
              Bulova made a watch called the "Accutron" that ran on a battery. 
              It was pretty<br>
              radical (and expensive). Most of us poor folks either wound our 
              Timexes manually<br>
              or else owned "self winders." Self winding watches had a small eccentrically<br>
              weighted wheel that constantly turned as a result of normal wrist 
              motion and<br>
              kept the mainspring wound. Your watch ran as long as you wore it, 
              but would<br>
              eventually stop if you took it off for long periods of time.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><span style="letter-spacing: 1pt"><br>
              So you can imagine the amazement that we all felt when the digital 
              watch sprang<br>
              upon the scene. This incredible little piece of electronics presented 
              a dark<br>
              face that showed the time when a button was pushed. The information 
              was<br>
              presented via actual numerals, ignoring the paradigm of a dial and 
              hands.<br>
              As I recall, in '75 you could obtain one of these technological 
              marvels for<br>
              around 150 bucks. Battery life was directly affected by the frequency 
              of<br>
              checking the time.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><span style="letter-spacing: 1pt"> 
              New owners would look approximately every thirty seconds.<br>
              This meant that the watch, guaranteed to be accurate to within a 
              minute per<br>
              year, would need to be shut down and reset about once every two 
              months. Once you<br>
              got past the novelty and settled into a routine of seeing what time 
              it was<br>
              perhaps ten times per day, then a battery might possibly last five 
              months.&nbsp;<br>
              To illustrate the technological jump that was made with this watch, 
              picture a<br>
              thirty-dollar Timex of the era. It was pretty bare-basic, no calendar 
              or<br>
              waterproof feature at that price.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><span style="letter-spacing: 1pt"> 
              A local realty advertised by giving away twelve little aluminum 
              calendars with bendable fingers that wrapped around your watchband, 
              one per month. That way you could get the time and the date with 
              one glance at your wrist. The watch's most telling feature was located 
              inside. If<br>
              you popped open the case, you found an adjustment marked "+" and 
              "-." This<br>
              allowed you to slow or speed the works in an effort to make the 
              darned thing<br>
              accurate to within, say, five minutes per month. If you managed 
              to make it keep<br>
              decent time, you held on to it for dear life. The adjustment process 
              might take<br>
              weeks to fine tune</span></font></p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><span style="letter-spacing: 1pt">.<br>
              So now, you could purchase a timekeeping device that did not vary 
              by more than a<br>
              minute in a year (or 25 seconds within the maximum five-month battery 
              life).<br>
              Simply astounding.&nbsp;<br>
              </span></font></p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><span style="letter-spacing: 1pt">I 
              was the proud owner of one of these babies. I used to blow the English 
              class<br>
              away with my ability to count down to the exact second that the 
              period would<br>
              end. I spent a few hours in detention for interrupting the teacher's 
              soliloquies<br>
              with "54321" countdowns that climaxed with that familiar ringing 
              sound. Oh<br>
              well, it was worth it.<br>
              </span></font></p>
            <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><span style="letter-spacing: 1pt">Then, 
              one day, I was stacking bags of sugar in the back of the store. 
              I had<br>
              taken the watch off, not wanting to damage my 150-dollar investment. 
              When we<br>
              finished unloading the truck, I took a break, leaving my watch on 
              a shelf in the<br>
              loading dock. The truck driver helped himself to it and "split," 
              as we used to<br>
              say.I reported the watch's theft to the local police, who showed 
              up and took a<br>
              detailed report. Needless to say, I never saw it again. I was sick 
              for weeks.<br>
              This brings us to today. LCD digital watches are routinely given 
              away as<br>
              advertising tokens. Battery life: five years. If one gets stolen, 
              you just buy a<br>
              twelve-pack of pop or the like and get another one for free. They 
              haven't made<br>
              LED's since the 70's. Digital watches, far from carrying the status 
              that they<br>
              once held, are now viewed as strictly casual wear. No self-respecting<br>
              businessman would be caught dead wearing one with a Hart, Shaffner, 
              and Marx<br>
              suit. How times change.<br>
