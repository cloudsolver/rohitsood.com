              <tr> 
                <td width="100%"><font size="2">So, like this dude had, like, 
                  a big cool kingdom and people liked him. But, like, his step-mom, 
                  or something, was kind of a bitch, and she forced her husband 
                  to, like, send this cool-dude, he was Ram, to some national 
                  forest or something... since he was going, for like, something, 
                  like more than 10 years or so.. he decided to get his wife and 
                  his bro along... you know...so that they could all chill out 
                  together.<br>
                  <br>
                  But DUDE, the forest was reeeeal scary shit...really man...they 
                  had monkeys and devils and shit like that. But this dude, Ram, 
                  kicked ass with darts and bows and arrows... so it was fine. 
                  But then some bad gangsta boys, some jerk called Ravan, picks 
                  up his babe (Sita) and lures her away to his hood. And boy, 
                  was our man, and also his bro, Lakshman, pissed...<br>
                  <br>
                  And you Don't piss this son-of-a-gun cuz, he just kicks ass 
                  and like...,all the gods were with him.. So anyways, you don't 
                  mess with gods. SO, Ram, and his bro get an army of monkeys.. 
                  dude, don't ask me how they trained the damn monkeys... just 
                  go along with me, ok... so, Ram, Laksh. and their monkeys whip 
                  this gangsta's ass in his own hood.<br>
                  <br>
                  Anyways, by this time, their time's up in the forest..and anyways...it 
                  gets kinda boring, you know... no TV or malls or shit like that. 
                  So, they decided to hitch a ride back home...and when the people 
                  realize that our dude, his bro and the wife are back home... 
                  they thought, well, you know, at least they deserve something 
                  nice... and they didn't have any bars or clubs in those days...so 
                  they couldn't take them out for a drink, so they, like, decided 
                  to smoke and shit...and since they also had some lamps, they 
                  lit the lamps also... so it was pretty cooool...you know with 
                  all those fireworks..really, they even had some local band play 
                  along with the fireworks..and you know, what, dude, that was 
                  the very first, no kidding.., that was the very first music-synchronized 
                  fireworks... you know, like the 4th of July stuff, but just, 
                  more cooler and stuff, you know.<br>
                  <br>
                  And, so dude, THAT was how, like, this festival started.<br>
                  <br>
