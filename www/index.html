																		<p>I know that the entire journey of business need to solution delivery is important. Every single step of business ideation through

																		<p>I believe it is not just about the ‘best’ idea, it’s about the smart ideas that are strategic

																				a very dynamic environment is where I have demonstrated excellence time and again.</p>
																		<p>In the past I have been successful in finding a good balance between what a team can achieve
																				and what a team can stretch to achieve to meet the pressing demands of the business. 
																				I believe that there is an art to managing complexity,

																				These are some of the variables
																				that need to be continuously balanced through the lifecycles of multiple solution deliveries spanning a broader digital strategic imperative such as digital transformation through application modernization.</p>

																		<a href="# target="_blank">IT Architecture Assessments | Future State Architecture Development</a>
																</h3>

																<p class="summary">Businesses depend on their core IT investments however over the course of time risks, trade offs, sensitivity points and benefits of the solution drift. It is prudent to first
																		shine a light on the current state with an architecture assessment that includes busines and technology. 
																		Most importantly, an assessment sets the stage for developing a target state solution
																		architecture and a roadmap. 
																		An objective, independent and instrumented architecture assessment is an invaluable
																		tool. Understanding the system landscape is made easier via standards-based post-vizualization and
																		supporting documentation. System architecture archeology is key to the discovery of unknown system elements that have trickled into the solution over time.
																		Visualizations, prioritized findings and analysis is imperative to understanding the current state architecture and aligning business stakeholders and executive IT leadership.</p>

																		</div>
																</div>

																<div class="desc text-left">

																		<p>Evaluation of the architecture should not result in 'Good' or 'Bad'. An assessment should
																				highlight where the system is at risk against quality attributes. A risk-based trade-off analysis is what typically guides my architectural assessment. 
																				An architecture assessment can be conducted with scope in mind that can vary. A functional capability assessment or
																				specific cross-cutting concerns (e.g. Integration, Security, Business Capability). Measure of Technical Debt against target strategy is important. </p>
																		<p>Enterprise architecture is the broadest is scope, it is an all-encompassing highest level of
																				abstraction review of the IT delivery to business capabilities. It is a risk-based capability-aware
																				architecture assessment. This assessment primarily traces business needs with the IT delivery
																				roadmap. Solution architectures assessments encompass the entire end-to-end IT solution. A full
																				review of a dynamic IT landscape that will assess the current trajectory of the project, program,
																				department and/or company. I have attended course work, and received certifications from the coveted
																				Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Specifically I have studied the
																				Architecture Tradeoff and Analysis Method (ATAM) in detail. Learning from it, and my own
																				professional experiences I have created a customized and high speed iterative architecture review
																				process. In practice I currently chair the architecture review board where I govern over a weekly
																				architecture review meeting cadence.</p>
																		<p>In addition, I also sit on the review board of enterprise architects. Every week I review
																				solutions that are internal to my domain where I provide guidance and mentoring to the architects
																				and I also serve on the review board of projects that fall outside of my domain. Over the past
																				several years I have standardized on common design patterns in large scale system architecture.
																				Interestingly I have observed how well intentioned architectures that are layered still suffer from
																				entropy over time.</p>
																				<p>
																				I have been passionate about quality attributes, quality, code quality and delivery. In 2002 I instituted a JUNIT testing paradigm when Unit Testing was an emerging concept. In 2003 I delived deeply into Static Analysis with automated risk based assessments. Quality checkpoints and code inspection were my focus in a major project. 
																				Code coverage, automated builds, continuous delivery and high speed software execution has been my most recent focus.

																		<p>
																				I specialize in catalyzing the entire SDLC lifecycle for high quality speedy delivery. An executable strategy makes the difference between vaporware and a tangible deliverable. I am one
																				of the many signatories of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org">Agile
																						Manifesto</a>. I believe that 'working software is the primary measure of success'. A development
																				discipline geared towards a high quality working software that meets the business needs is core and
																				foundational. 
																				</p>
																				<p>
																				One of the weaknesses I often see repeating themselves is the Requirements discipline and it's communication to the design and development team. While
																				the requirements discipline has matured, in my opinion, this area continues to be a weakness. I have developed strategies to push for high quality requirements and often it results in understanding the organization and it's implict and explicit needs. 
																		</p>
																		<p>Another area to work on is a well-socialized solution description that is backed by sound
																				rationale. Materially signifiant decisions made (and the non-decisions) must be well understood and communicated. While the current state architecture
																				provides visibility, the target state provides a goal to achieve for the team. Start with the Why. Then select an effective path to get
																				there. A sound execution plan on paper is not enough. I have used and re-used tactics that I have developed over the years to give teams a boost. 
																				At a higher level of abstract a roadmap can be vizualized for
																				socialization and complex project dependency mappings as needed. At a lower level the dynamics are vastly difference. A technology leader must understand and operate at both and multiple levels to ensure success.</p>
																		<p>This is where ‘rubber meets the road’.</p>

																				<a href="#" target="_blank">Internet of Things: Machine Data Analytics</a>
																		</h3>
																		<p>Internet of Things (IoT) is of particular interest to me. In 2009, I delved heavily into Real
																				Time Machine data analytics and prototyped a solution to parse and scan gigabytes worth of machine
																				data in real-time. It went to pilot, and within 5 years has spread across a very vast internal IT
																				landscape. I am always looking at opportunities to explore, cross-reference and squeeze more meaning
																				out of data. I am now more and more interested in Big Data semantics and visual delivery to multiple
																				form factors via live dashboards.</p>
																		<p>In my opinion, IoT brings to the forefront efficient and real-time Big Data solution needs that
																				are efficient. Giga/Tera and in some organizations Peta bytes of data will have to be parsed,
																				analyzed and visualized. connected devices that are Internet connected devices. Data from devices
																				has largely been an untapped source of valuable information.</p>
																		<p>
																				According to a report by Cisco (<a
																						href="http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac79/docs/innov/IoT_IBSG_0411FINAL.pdf"
																				>IBSG, April 2011</a>) - it is estimated there will be 50 Billion Internet connected devices by 2020.
																				Gartner predicts 26 Billion on the Internet of Things. Regardless of the extrapolation accuracy, we
																				can conclude that the growth is logarithmic. Specifically the field of Machine Data Analytics is
																				burgeoning and will be at the forefront. We may have more data and even more information at our
																				finger tips that will allow us to make better informed decisions. Each device will be generating
																				machine data and logs: home automation, cars, truck fleets, homes, electrical grids, medical
																				devices, rfid scanners, and not to mention mobile application and web app log files.
																		<p>In 2013, I did a demonstration at the company Technology Roadshow, it was a wonderful
																				experience to showcase and explain this amazing technology and opportunity to others.</p>

																				<a href="#" target="_blank">Pattern Based Integration Architecture</a>
																		</h3>
																		<p>Data integration is an important and more often an assumed implicit aspect for nearly all architecturally significant solutions. In my experience availability, scalability and stability of the integrations are increasingly expected by default by the business.
																				System to system integration is expected to flawless. These high expectation must be met
																				with a high quality design.</p>

																		<p>Pattern based integration architectures comes with specifically selected design patterns from
																				various design pattern catalogs including the Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP), Gang of Four
																				(GoF), J2EE Patterns, Big Data Patterns and other catalogs. Industry standards and expert accepted
																				best-practices have already been applied to create these. As the solution architect I compose the
																				appropriate combination of the design patterns to formulate a solution that meets the business
																				needs. The target state integration architecture models and detailed design patterns are key
																				artifacts that describe the solution and document early decisions about the system that is to be
																				built. I document, explain, whiteboard the detailed patterns, solution details, technology
																				specifications with the development team. This gives them a great start to the effort and helps
																				connect the dots when they refer to the manuals I have written.</p>
																		<p>The specific selection of patterns and guidelines I write most often are documented in vendor
																				neutral terminology. Design flexibility and solution sustainability are most often my key goals.</p>

																		<a href="#">Tennis</a>
																</h3>
																<p class="summary">I was first introduced to tennis court at age 6. I was not inclined towards it at first. However, after a few months and coaching I saw my game improve. This encouraged me. My father would play nearly every day of the week. I started playing regularly as well. After a few years I began entering tennis tournaments. 
																		I did reasonably well. Most notably my father and I won a doubles championship when I was 14.</p>
																<p>After graduating high school, I joined the tennis team of my engineering college. Within the first year I became the number 1 seed. The following year we won the inter-college University championship.
																Following that I represented my university at the Nationals level
																		as the top seed and captain. To encourage others to play I taught tennis to engineering students pro-bono. I was interviewed by ESPN India
																		when I trained to be a tennis pro. I earned the USPTR certified professional.</p>
																<p>I play casually at least once a week at the Carmel Racquet Club, occasionally I get invited to play at the Five
																		Seasons, Health Plex and West Indy Racquet Club.</p>
																<p>My dream is to open a charity for under privileged youth and give them access to tennis
																		instruction. I believe a sport like tennis prevents young kids from veering into negative behaviors.</p>
